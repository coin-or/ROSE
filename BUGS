ROSE / Ev3 Known bugs
---------------------

- Loss of memory when deallocating Ev3 trees; this is due to a disabled
  delete which causes a segmentation fault when enabled. This bug has 
  been present for a long time but I never managed to track it down
  [LEO100627]

- ROSE doesn't like constants added to the objective function - better
  removing them and adding them back later. This might be troublesome
  when ROSE is used from within AMPL. [LEO100627]

- the solvers: gomory, limitedbranch, localbranch, sbb, subgradient, tabu, vns
  are "numerical solvers" and have been disabled in this distribution (in 
  any case some of them are in very early development and/or discontinued)

- the solvers: Rdisaggr, Roa, Rrelaxation are incomplete
