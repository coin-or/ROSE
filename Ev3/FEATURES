1) operators act on *this
2) n-ary trees
3) coefficient applies to every kind of operator/operand
4) exponent only applies to leaves
5) solid architecture and hierarchical structure
6) [run efficiency tests against maple]
7) could implement "grey box" functions for conditional functions
   where the conditions only depends on the value of the function args,
   e.g. f(x) = sin(x) if x < 0, x^2 if x >= 0

- Standard ordering for an expression (see expression.cxx:NodeOrder()) is:
  constants + variables + variables^{powers in rising order} + operators

- POWER is used when the base or exponent are expressions; otherwise 
  the Set/GetExponent mechanisms are used.

- Creating expression is done either by making new nodes out of
  each new created expression (operator+, operator-, operator*,
  operator/, operator^, Log, Exp, Sin, Cos,...) or linking the
  old nodes to the new one (SumLink, DifferenceLink, ProductLink,
  FractionLink, PowerLink, LogLink, ExpLin, SinLink, CosLink, ...).

- When you change the -Link versions, also remember to change the
  non-Link, and vice versa.

- varindex should always start from 1
