The architecture of Ev3, based on recursive template inheritance, makes
it a hard test for C++ compiler; thus porting is limited to extremely
good compilers.

gcc 2.95.2				... native development, OK
gcc 2.7.2.3				... compiles OK(1)
Borland C++ compiler for i386 5.2	... won't compile tree.cxx:90
Sun C++ compiler for sparc 5.0		... won't compile tree.cxx:90
MS VC++ 4.0				... won't compile (broken STL)
MS VC++ 6.0				... compiles and runs OK

--- Notes ---
(1): Ev3 will compile seamlessly with gcc 2.7.2.3 but a segmentation
fault will occur in the parser, as a bug either in the compiler or in
the accompanying (on Debian slink) std c++ library prevents input->get() 
to successfully return 0 on occurrence of EOF - it raises a segmentation 
fault instead. Other uses of Ev3 (apart from the built-in parser, that is) 
are possible.
