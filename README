INTRODUCTION

The ROSE (Reformulation/Optimization Software Engine) is a software
for performing symbolic reformulations to Mathematical Programs
(MP). MPs are formal representations of optimization problems, and
reformulations could be defined as rewriting systems taking MPs to
other MPs which also conserve some property, such as e.g. the set of
optima. 

The ROSE is usually used as an AMPL solver, and is itself a collection
of sub-solvers (most of which perform either some symbolic
reformulation or analysis task). Once a model (with data) has been
loaded into the AMPL workspace, the user types

  option solver roseamp;
  option roseamp_options "mainsolver=N [other options]";
  solve;

to call ROSE. ROSE's subsolvers are selected through an ordinal
N. Typing "roseamp" from the shell command line will list the
subsolvers that have built in the locally installed systems.

Originally, we distributed a ROSE system with many numerical solvers
as well as symbolic reformulators. We eventually made the decision of
limiting ROSE to what it does best - reformulations only. Thus, you
might find some options which refer to solvers that have are not
actually present (sorry).

MPs can be classified in two types: flat and structured. Flat MPs are
those whose constraints are not indexed and whose variables consist of
one symbol only, indexed by a scalar. Numerical solvers usually
require flat MPs as input. Structured MPs allow variables and
constraints to be quantified over complicated set structures. AMPL
itself takes structured MPs as input. AMPL, however, does not allow
solvers either to access the structured MP or to change the MP
internally. Thus, ROSE's action is usually limited to reading a flat
MP and outputting a text-formatted version of the (reformulated) flat
MP. 

ROSE uses the Ev3 library (developed by the same team and distributed
according to the same license as ROSE) in order to store and
reformulate mathematical expressions occurring in MPs. Expressions are
represented as n-ary trees, where leaf nodes correspond to variables
and constants (0-ary operators) and non-leaf nodes with n subnodes
correspond to n-ary operators. An arc (u,v) occurs in an expression
tree if v is an argument of the operator u. See Ev3/ for more details.

SOLVERS

ROSE consists of a collection of (numerical) solvers and
reformulators. Most reformulator names are prefixed by a capital
letter 'R'. Solvers solve a problem numerically; reformulators operate
on the symbolic structure of the instance to output a different
representation (e.g. a relaxation, or an input format for a different
software).

In this distribution all numerical solvers have been disabled (most of
them require different subsolvers, some of which are not free).

Solver/Reformulator list:

DEVELOPER'S NOTES

To access the source code, type:

svn checkout svn+ssh://hammer.lix.polytechnique.fr/home/savourey/svnrepository/rose

Procedure to create a new solver:

1. cp and edit solver_TEMPLATE.cxx/.h to new solver name (search/replace)
2. Makefile: add new object to OBJS
3. newsolver.cxx (add new solver / delete new solver / include .h)
4. problem.cxx (add solvername/params in the ampl interface)
5. rose.cxx (add help)
