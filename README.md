# ROSE

## What is it?

Optimization problems are usually defined in terms of their mathematical programming formulation.
This consists of a set of objective functions to be optimized subject to a set of constraints, all expressed in terms of a set of decision variables which may be discrete or continuous.
Formulations may be symbolically transformed so that some of their numerical properties (e.g. optimal solutions, feasible region,...) are invariant.
Yet sometimes the reformulated problem is easier to solve or is useful within a given solution algorithm.
The main aims of this project are a systematic study of reformulation theory, the production of software tools for automating mathematical programming reformulation, and the formalization and implementation of solution algorithms based on reformulation techniques.
