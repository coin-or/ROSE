At the moment the distribution is being put together. As a consequence, 
there are far fewer examples here than we would like - apologies.

In order for these examples to work, you need rose, roseamp and ampl
to be installed somewhere in your path.

Please write to the software maintainer (savourey@lix.polytechnique.fr)
if you need further assistance.
